This was the 5th project completed while taking CSC245 Secure Software Development at Arapahoe Community College. The goal of this project was to perform a static code analysis scan using Parasoft Jtest on one of several Java projects and analyze the results. In this project, it was chosen to analyze results from scanning Spotify's [GitHub-Java-Client](https://github.com/spotify/github-java-client) project. The task associated with this project laid out in further depth in the Project-5-Assignment.docx file. The analysis of the results from the Parasoft Jtest scan can be seen in the Project-5-Report.pdf document.
